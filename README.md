Hi, I'm a 16 and I'm quite new at programming. I did a course in school once for a year and I learned a bit of Python and HTML. I'm now trying to rescue this habit because I remember I really used to enjoy it. Hope we can help ourselves in whatever we need :)
Space weed is much better that Earth weed. I can guarantee that.
